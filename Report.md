### A.2 Data Descripton

To solve the above problem I use the below data

- list of different neighborhoods in San Fransisco city. I got this from data.sfgov.org. 
- I got the lattitude and longitude of the midpoint of each neighborhood from maps.google.com
- I am using the Foursquare API to get the details of the venues in each neighborhood
- I plan to merge this data with the san franciso house rent and price I scraped from www.bayareamarketreports.com website
